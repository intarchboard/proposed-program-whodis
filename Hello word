ABOUT THE SUPERTOOL!
All of your MX record, DNS, blacklist and SMTP diagnostics in one integrated tool.  Input a domain name or IP Address or Host Name. Links in the results will guide you to other relevant tools and information.  And you'll have a chronological history of your results. 

If you already know exactly what you want, you can force a particular test or lookup.  Try some of these examples:

(e.g. "blacklist: 127.0.0.2" will do a blacklist lookup)

Command	 	Explanation
blacklist:	 	Check IP or host for reputation
smtp:	 	Test mail server SMTP (port 25)
mx:	 	DNS MX records for domainFind IPv6 - IPv6 Tools
