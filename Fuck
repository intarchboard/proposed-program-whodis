 3.  Extractor Definition

NEW:

 3.  Signalling Extractors
 
    Other protocols which wish to use extractors SHOULD have some way for
    the peers to signal that an extractor will be used.  An example is a
    TLS extension, as used in DTLS-SRTP.
 
 4.  Extractor Definition


Section 2., paragraph 6:
OLD:

           PRF(master_secret, "EXTRACTOR" + label,
               SecurityParameters.client_random +
               SecurityParameters.server_random)[length]

NEW:

           PRF(master_secret, label,
               SecurityParameters.client_random +
               SecurityParameters.server_random)[length]


Section 2., paragraph 8:
OLD:

    Label values MUST be registered via Specification Required as
    described by RFC 2434 [2].

NEW:

    Label values MUST be registered via Specification Required as
    described by RFC 2434 [2].  Note that extractor labels have the
    potential to collide with existing PRF labels.  In order to prevent
    this, labels SHOULD begin with "EXTRACTOR".  This is not a MUST
    because there are existing uses which have labels which do not begin
    with this prefix.

 6.  IANA Considerations


Section 2., paragraph 12:
OLD:

    Section Section 3 requires that all extractor labels be registered
    via 2434 Specification Required.  IANA has created a TLSExtractor
    registry for this purpose.  Future values MUST be allocated via
    Specification Required as described in [RFC2434].

NEW:

    IANA is requested to create (has created) a TLS Extractor Label
    registry for this purpose.  The initial contents of the registry are
    given below:

Section 2., paragraph 14:
OLD:

 6.1.  Normative References

NEW:

    Future values are allocated via RFC2434 Specification Required
    policy.  The label is a string consisting of printable ASCII
    characters.  IANA MUST also verify that one label is not a prefix of
    any other label.  For example, labels "key" or "master secretary" are
    forbidden.
