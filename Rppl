OUR STRENGTH
Why choose DB-IP

Experience and innovation
Since 2010 our passionate team works hard to provide the most comprehensive and accurate IP address database that has grown to more than 32 million IPv4 and IPv6 blocks.

Accurate and up to date
We aggregate data from a large number of sources and through agreements with popular ISPs. We constantly evolve our machine learning models for more accurate IP address geolocation.

Ultra scalable global network
Our server infrastructure is highly redundant and spans over multiple continents. If you need more than our standard API plans we can build your own private API infrastructure to handle any kind of load or special needs, just contact us.
OUR FEATURES
What we can offer
IP Address Geolocation
Our geolocation data set covers the whole IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces with more than 2 million unique locations in 215,000+ cities worldwide. It is interoperable with popular third party geographic services such as the Geonames open database.


Localization
Show your non-english speaking visitors the place names they are used to. We support country, state, district and city name localization in more than fifty languages including Chinese, Russian, Farsi, Spanish, French and live amount conversions for more than 50 currencies.

Dashboard & alerts
From your API dashboard you are able to manage your keys, watch your API usage in real-time and analyze its historical trends. You may also setup email alerts whenever you go near or over your daily quota.


try {
	$info = DBIP\Address::lookup($visitorIp);
	if ($info->threatLevel === "high") {
		header("Status: 403 Forbidden");
		die();
	}
	setlocale(LC_ALL, $info->languages[0]);
	echo sprintf(_("Hello %s !"), $info->city);
} catch (DBIP\ServerError $e) {
	// Invalid key or address
	Log::Warning($e->getMessage());
}
Easy Integration
It only takes a few minutes to add IP geolocation awareness to your application. Our API uses RESTful semantics supported by all major development platforms, and we offer free open-source API query libraries and CSV import tools.

Threat level assessment
Protect your web application, customer data and network infrastructure from cyber attacks. Our threat level indicator is computed in real-time from several security flags such as anonymous proxy usage or known attack sources.

{
	isCrawler: false,
    isProxy: true,
	proxyType: "vpn",
    threatLevel: "high",
    threatDetails: [
		"anonymous-proxy",
        "attack-source",
		"attack-target:web"
        "bot-name:gherran",
        "bot-type:spam"
