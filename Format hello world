I don't see any problem with using the word anti-pattern. It's well 
established. The document should make sure that those who don't know the 
term find the right definition/explanation easily (probably not by 
restating it :-).

One additional (tangential) point below:

The prefix "anti-" (from Greek, main meaning against/opposed) and
the prefix "ante-" (from Latin, main meaning before/preceeding) are 
spelled almost the same, but are different.
(I had a hunch, but I had to look this up myself, too
(hint: Add "etymology" in your search field). What may add to the 
confusion is that both prefixes seem to originate from the same 
Indo-European word stem.)
